                    <p>a) Do Reconnaissance, use the tool nmap and you will find Apache server running <br>
                        b) Visit the website (search the ip on the browser),view page source you will find a username (keep it) <br>
                        c) Use the tool nikto to scan the web server , we will find : robots.txt, /login.php
                    </p>

                    d) Here we will read the txt files, use cat command but it will not work , then try less command ,yay!!! it works <br> 
                    e) We will get the first ingredient in the txt file (first flag)<br>
